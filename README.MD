# Book Cover Design

## Task 3: Book Cover Design

Welcome to Task 3 of our Book Cover Design project. In this task, we will continue our creative journey as we delve deeper into designing an engaging and thought-provoking book cover.

## Design Concept

In Task 2, we explored the initial stages of designing a captivating book cover. We aimed to create a visual representation that would intrigue potential readers and convey the essence of the book. Now, in Task 3, we are taking our design concept to the next level. Our goal is to craft a book cover that not only captivates the eye but also tells a story. 

We are going to use a white portrait-shaped background with cloud-grey shades, setting the stage for our design elements.

## Design Elements

### 1. Background

- **White Portrait Shape Background**: The canvas for our book cover will be a white portrait-shaped background. The simplicity of white will create a sense of clarity and contrast, making the design elements stand out.

- **Cloud Grey Shades**: We will incorporate various shades of cloud grey to add depth and a subtle, enigmatic atmosphere to the cover. These shades will help convey the mysterious nature of the book's content.

### 2. Central Element

- **Red Circle (Top Middle)**: Placed at the top-middle of the book cover, a bold and eye-catching red circle will draw immediate attention. This element symbolizes the core theme or focal point of the book.

- **Logo**: Inside the red circle, we will prominently display the logo that has been previously created. The logo features a blue spiral with intricate black human nerves in the center. This design element serves as a visual representation of the book's subject matter, which likely revolves around the intersection of human and artificial intelligence.

### 3. Title and Subtitle

- **Title**: The book is titled "EVAI." This short and impactful title is a fusion of "EVIL" and "AI," suggesting a compelling narrative that explores the dark side of artificial intelligence.

- **Subtitle**: Beneath the title, we have a subtitle that reads "For InfoAid Tech Technology." This subtitle provides context and hints at the technological aspect of the book's theme.
